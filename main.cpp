/* OUTLINE
Program starts by setting the scene and describing the world the adventure 
game is set in, then you are taken to the first challenge: choose your animal. 
You choose which animal you want to tame, give it a name, and provide your 
username. A text file will be read in, with all the animals and their levels 
for different skills, and you will pick between 3 animals for each tier. For 
the first tier or first animal you tame, the options are a ferret, parrot, or 
monkey, the second tier is a wolf, snow leopard, or owl, and finally when you 
have trained your animals from the two tiers to a sufficient level, you will 
unlock the polar bear: once you have tamed it you have won the game. 
The user is taken through a series of challenges in different locations, 
their animal increases their level in a given skill if the user makes the right 
decisions in the challenge, else they will loop back to the beginning of the 
challenge and must try again. When you have gone through level one of each of 
the challenges, the program will display the animal’s stats and give you a menu
for different challenges you can choose to do to further improve the animal’s 
skills to the necessary level to move on. Each animal will need to go through 
a certain number of levels to be trained in that skill, Once you have finished 
enough levels to tame the animal, you will have the option to either quit the 
game, pick an animal from the next tier, or continue moving through the levels 
of the challenges. After finishing the second tier you unlock the polar bear, 
where instead of having challenges related to improving your skill, you look 
for the golden compass with the help of the polar bear to eventually win the 
game. Along the way you can collect gold to buy certain items, and random 
challenges will pop up that can either give bonus points to your animal’s 
skill, or will cause your animal to run away which will cause you to go back 
to the beginning. */
