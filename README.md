CS 1 Animal Tamer Final Project

- This was the final project for my first ever computing class, I worked on it with a friend
- Learned about storyline planning and how to make our ideas come to life using code
- Beginnings of learning how to utilize functions, create classes and objects, reading and writing to a file
- Its a silly beginner level game where you go on a series of "adventures" with your animal, and certain decisions level up the animal
